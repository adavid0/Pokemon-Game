The app so far only contains the outline of the Pokemon Game.
The app, as it is now, can : 
1) Let the user decide up to ONE pokemon(s).
2) Has ONE enemy pokemon(s) which is predetermined to be of level 100 and type FIRE.
3) Decides victory / defeat based on damage multiplier (proper setup) WITHOUT hitpoint calculation.
4) Has three pokemon types FIRE, GRASS and WATER.


Yet to be done:
1) Include all pokemon types.
2) Develop a hitpoint induced battle system.
3) Make a list of random locations and random pokemon and randomize the enemy pokemon encounter.


May or may not be done:
1) Split battle system to turn based game mode.
2) Create a proper interactive location based pokemon world system.
